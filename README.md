# UNITY
We aim to build a mobile application that will be able to perform two functions.
1. One of the reasons of casualties in a Natural Disaster is the lack of knowledge and information about the particular disaster.
   So we aim to spread awareness and give kowledge to people. According to their location they will be sent One Notification in 
   One Day named as ,"TIP OF THE DAY", which will give them a tip about the natural disaster which is common in that region.
2. During any disaster,it is always better to be in groups than being alone.Hence we aim to connect people stuck in such a situation
   with other people stuck nearby using their locations so they can reach out to one another.

# Our APPLICATION would provide:
* Interface having a search option to search nearby people in the disaster.
* An alerting system t alert people befre a disaster.
* Time Picker tool to set up time for daily notifications giving knowledge of what to do and how to prepare before and during a natural
  disaster.
  
#  The app will be having a simple, easy to understand user friendly interface.
  
 ## DATABASE AND TECHNOLOGY
1. We are using Google's Firebase Database to store our data of information and daily tips related to the disasters.
2. We are using Android studio to make the app which will be supported by KOTLIN.
